KIRAKIRA's console


### Install
Run this command after you clone this repo.
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development
Start development server.\
You need to run the backend service [KIRAKIRA-Rosales](https://github.com/KIRAKIRA-DOUGA/KIRAKIRA-Rosales) separately, otherwise the program will not work as expected.
```bash
pnpm run dev-local
```
Then you should be able to access the development server in https://localhost:3000
